# BookStore Project 

## 1. Analysis Phase:
**Project Description:**
- We are creating a simple API for a bookstore that manages authors and books. This API will allow the user to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on both authors and books. 

### Models
- Author
- book : where we are gonna link each book with an author (one author can create multiple book)

### Requirements
1. **Author:** (CRUD)
2. **Book:** (CRUD)
3. **Relationships:** 
    - each book must associated with exactly one author.
    - An author can have zero or more books.

4. **Fields:**
    - Author -> (name)
    - Book -> (title, author, publication_year)

5. **API Behavior:**
    - data validation

6. **General Instructions:**
    - No authentication or authorization needed we can do it later on.
    - Just use JSON for request and response.
    - we don't need to make the author name uniqe we can handel it with the ID.
